# What are the Best Programming Languages for Building APIs?## IntroductionAre you in the process of designing your first web application? Maybe you have built some in the past but are looking for a change in language to increase your skillset or try out something new.  If you fit in those categories, then you are in the right place.  With all the information out there it could be hard to decide on what programming language to select for your next product or project. 

Since any programming language can ultimately be used to write APIs some can be better and more efficient to use than others. Today we will be discussing the things to take into consideration when choosing that programming language to build out APIs for your web app.
## Comfort Ability

This goes out to any developer that has experience in a certain language.  If you already have experience  in a language then you will ultimately have an easier time developing, understanding the concepts involved, and be able to make more progress right out of the gate. This translates to improved code and performance as well, because you can spend more time on that rather than learning a brand new programming language.  For example, if I have been developing in Python for a few years, but I have the option between using PHP or Python as a programming language for the project, I would simply select Python due to the time saved already spent learning Python.

This is extremely important because when trying to do something new, you want to limit the amount of unknowns that you will have in the project.  That will help your learning and help achieve better results.

If you are a brand new developer with zero programming experience, then the following section might help you narrow your results!


## Libraries & Frameworks

The next question to ask in your process of eliminating potential programming languages to build out your API is *Does the language come with plenty of different options for libraries or frameworks that aid in the developing of APIs?*

To continue with the Python example in the previous section, there is the Django REST Framework that is specifically build on top of Django, which is a web development framework for Python, that is made for creating an API in Python faster and easier.  Did you hear faster and easier? Why yes you did, that is why this is important. 

These libraries and frameworks allow you to speed up the development process by containing functions and objects that handle plenty of the repetitive or dirty work in building an API.  Once you have spent some time researching  what is available  to you in terms of libraries and frameworks for languages, it is time to check out how active the communities are! 

## Support & Community

The next questions to ask yourself in this process is *Are the frameworks and libraries for this programming language still being supported? If so, how active is the community of developers?*

Do they have continuous  or regular updates to their software and capabilities? Do the updates help improve security and usability?  After all you would not want to continue to use this language if not many people use it and it is not being updated for bug fixes in the future.

Another thing to pay attention to is the community of users.  Are there plenty of resources for you to learn from? How clear and available is the documentation? Are there experienced developers that have blog posts on the topics necessary to learn? Are there questions being asked and answered on Stack Overflow? Are there any hard resources such as magazines or textbooks that show you how to use these languages and frameworks?

## Potential Languages

From my experience here are a few of the better programming languages and an example framework for that language that you can use to start developing your next API:

| Language        | Framework    |
| ----------------|:------------:|
| Java            | Spring       |
| JavaScript(Node)| Express      |
| Python          | Django       |
| PHP             | Lavarel      |
| Ruby            | Ruby on Rails|


## Conclusion In the end, the programming language you select depends on a few factors: your experience with the language, the frameworks available for API building, and how active the support and the community are. Do not be afraid to try something new! You can always learn but if you are concerned on speed and ease of development use these criteria to help select the language of use.
