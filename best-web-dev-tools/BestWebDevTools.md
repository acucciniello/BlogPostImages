#  The Best Tools to Improve Your Development Workflow
## IntroductionHey all! I am writing to you today for the web developers out there who are looking for some tools that can help them become more productive and efficient developers.  I will go through some of the basic tools you must take a look at in order to become a better web developer.  

## Text Editors

![atom](https://github.com/acucciniello/BlogPostImages/blob/master/best-tools-web-dev/atom.gif)First off, where do we write our code? That's right, in text editors.  You need to have a text editor that you trust and one that you love.  I have used a couple that I will recommend you check out.  

Currently I am using [Atom][atom].  It is a text editor that is minimal but can have plenty of features added to it.  You may install various plugins that make things easier, or connect it to things like GitHub for your source control needs with your project.

Another text editor I use is [Sublime Text][slime].  This is extremely similar to Atom, it is actually a little faster to open than Atom as well.  The only issue with this editor is that when you are using the free version, it asks you to donate or buy every couple of times you save a file.  This can get annoying, but nonetheless, a very powerful editor.

The main key here is to find something that you *love*.  Stick with it, and learn the ins and outs of it.  You want to become a pro with it.  This will greatly increase your productivity if you know your text editor in and out.## Source Control

![Octocat](https://github.com/acucciniello/BlogPostImages/blob/master/best-tools-web-dev/octocat.gif)High on list of must have tools for web development or even just development in general, is a form of Source Control.  You need a place to backup your code and save in multiple states.  It also allows for better and easier collaboration between multiple people working in different branches.  

I recommend using git and [GitHub][gh].  The user interface is very friendly and the two integrate seamlessly.  I have also used Subversion and AWS Code Commit, but these did not leave as great as impression as GitHub did.  

Source Control is so important make sure that you have selected it and use it for every project.  It also doubles as a place to display your code over time! ## Command Line InterfacesThis is not a specific tool per say, because it is already part of your computer.  If you have a Mac or Linux, it is terminal, if you have Windows it is the command shell. I recommend learning as many of the commands that you can.  You can do things like create files, create directories, delete files, edit files, and so much more.  It allows you to be so much more productive.  You must think of this as your go to tool for plenty of things you end up doing.

Pro Tip for Windows Users: I personally do not like the Windows Command Prompt nearly as much as the Unix one.  Look into using [Cygwin][cygwin] which allows you to use Unix commands on a windows command prompt.
  ## DebuggingIf you are doing anything in web development you need to be able to debug your code.  No one writes perfect code and you will inevitably spend time fixing bugs.  In order to reduce time spent on bugs, you should look into a tool that can help you with debugging.

Personally, if you are using Google Chrome, I suggest using [Chrome DevTools][cdevtools].  It allows you to set breakpoints, edit code, manipulate page elements as well as checking all css properties of the different html elements on the page.  It is extremely powerful and can help you when debugging to see what is happening in real time on the webpage.  ## HTTP Client

![postman](https://github.com/acucciniello/BlogPostImages/blob/master/best-tools-web-dev/postman.png)Lastly, I believe you would need something like [Postman][pman] to test HTTP requests from web services.  It makes it extremely easy to test and create APIs.  You can make all different types of requests, pass in whatever headers you want and see what the response is like!  This is important for any developer that needs to make API requests.## Conclusion There you have it, the best tools for web development, in my opinion. I hope this list has helped you get started in improving your web development workflow.  Always be on the lookout for improving your toolset as time goes on.  I believe you can always improve, why not let these tools make it easier for you!
