# How do Web Development Frameworks Drive Changes in Languages?

## Introduction

If you have been keeping up with technologies lately through various news sites like Hacker News and in the open source community on GitHub, you probably noticed it seems like there have been web development frameworks that are popping up left and right.  It can be overwhelming to follow them all and understand how they are causing things to change in the technology world. 

As developers we want to be able to catch a web development trend early and improve our skills with the technology that will be used in the future.  Let's discuss the effect of web development frameworks and how they drive change in languages.

## What is a Web Development Framework?

Before we continue, let's make sure that everyone is on same page with what exactly a web development framework is.  It is defined as software that is created to aid in the creation and development of web applications.  They are usually made to help out with speeding up common tasks that a web developer runs into.

There are client side frameworks which help with speeding up front-end work, along with helping to make dynamic web pages. Some Examples would be React.js and Angular.js.

There are also server side web development frameworks that help with creating a server, handling routes, and much more.  A few examples of this kind of framework are Express.js, Django, and Rails.

Now that we know exactly what a web development framework is, how do they affect languages?

## Effects on Languages

### Quantity

Stack Overflow recently came out with a new [Developer Survey][stackOverFlow] for 2017 where they interviewed 64,000 developers and asked them a wide variety of questions.  One question was the usage of languages that they have been using.  Here is a graph of their findings:

By looking at this graph, it shows the percent of developers using a language from the year 2013 and compares it to 2017.  Four years may not be a long period of time for other fields but for Software Engineers, that is a century.  We can see that the usage for languages such as C#, C, and C++ all have been decreasing over those years.  Meanwhile Node.js and Python usage have increased over those time periods.

After doing some research on the amount of prominent web development frameworks that have come out for these languages in the past couple years, I noticed a couple of things. C had one framework that came out in 2015. C++ had four web development frameworks over those years. On the other hand, Python had 17 frameworks aiding its development and Node.js had nine frameworks in the past three alone.

What does this all mean? Well, it seems as if the languages that received more web development frameworks to make development easier for the engineers, increased the amount of users for that language, while the others that did not receive as many web development frameworks, ended up being used less and less.

**Verdict: There must be a at least a correlation between the amount of web development frameworks and the corresponding language's usage.**

### Ease of Use & Quality

Not all of these frameworks are created equal.  Some web development frameworks are extremely easy to use when starting out and for others it can take longer to create your first web application.  Time is a factor when learning a new framework (or migrating existing software to it) and if it is not easy to pick up that framework, that can be a barrier to usage.

Another factor is having previous experience with the language.  A reason why Node.js has an increasing user base is because it is written in JavaScript.  If you have done any basic front end development then you must use some JavaScript to make your application. When learning a new web framework, if you have to learn a new obscure language that does not have many other uses, it does not make it easier for the developer hence slowing down transition time.

Lastly, if the framework itself does not actually make web development tasks for the engineer any easier or not much easier, then that language will end up being used less.

**Verdict: If the framework is easy to use and speeds up development time, more people will use it and move towards it.**

## Conclusion 

Overall, there are two clear factors of web development frameworks that drive changes in languages.  If there are plenty of frameworks then people will be more likely to use that language that the framework was created for.  If the frameworks are simple and really speed up development time they also will increase the language usage.
