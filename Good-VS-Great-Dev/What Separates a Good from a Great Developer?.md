# What Separates a Good from a Great Developer?
## IntroductionHey there! I am writing this for developers looking to get to that next level and become a great developer as opposed to someone who is considered just a good developer. In my opinion, there a fine line between the two but it could involve long term consequences if you do not get yourself to that next level.  This may also be a different route then most of you expected as I will be talking about various "soft" skills that will make a programmer great in the long term. 

## Ability to Learn

An Engineer's capacity to learn new topics effectively and quickly is crucial.  In a world of changing frameworks and standards that evolves by the day, this skill has never been needed more.  You do not want someone on your team who only knows Java and does not want to learn anything else.  Just because your company is using Java today, does not mean that it will be using Java a few years from now, heck even two months from now it could be completely different.  You ideally want someone who has displayed their ability to go deep with at least one language or technology and can transfer that depth of knowledge over to other areas at an extremely fast rate.
## Positive Thinker

In life, one's attitude towards a situation could greatly effect where he or she will end up.  You simply do not want someone with just a deep technical experience because the way you think about the things presented to you truly effects your ability to produce daily.

A positive thinker is someone who always sees the benefits that can be taken from a situation.  That person is also more likely to take beneficial risks and will produce more in the end.  The thinking of this individual will influence other team members as well and make the entire team more productive as a result.  ## Great Interpersonal & Intrapersonal Skills 

This skill can be described as someone who knows how to work with others in a positive and likeable manner.  They know how to handle themselves, their emotions, and communicate with others.  We were not put on this earth alone.  We must deal with others.  If you cannot deal with others in a positive manner, then you will not be a great developer who can create something revolutionary.

Having this skill allows you to avoid conflicts with others, help get ideas across effectively and provide a better work environment which in hand will make for a more productive and effective team.
## Ability to Teach Others

Not everyone is a good teacher.  As you probably already know, there are plenty of teachers that are not good at teaching.  It is a difficult skill to put yourself in someone else's shoes and move them to understanding of a specific topic.  If you have a good teacher on your engineering team, you can hugely increase the level of your team's output.

They do not need to have a PHD in vocabulary or have written three novels to get the ideas across.  For this, they just need to be able to make things clear for the other person and leaving nothing up for questioning by being able to see things from their perspective.
## Make Long Term vs Short Term TradeoffsSometimes, developers can solve problems that you give them but without the perspective necessary for the larger and longer term picture.  They may be able to develop something very fast that solves your immediate problem, but create it in a way that will not allow this functionality to scale.  

Other times there may be a deadline to ship some code, but the engineer may take his time developing software that handles every case.  In this scenario, you would want them to make a short term tradeoff to hit the deadline and refactor later.  

We want someone who can make these time versus quality tradeoffs depending on the intricacies of the scenario.
## Conclusion Overall, there are some qualities that make a good developer transcend into a great developer: The capacity to learn, the ability to teach effectively, having a positive attitude at all times, awesome communication and interpersonal skills, and the capacity to make decisions that could affect short term and long term results.  If you enjoyed this post share it on [twitter][twit]!
