# What makes Programming Languages Simple or Complex?## IntroductionHave you been itching to learn a new programming language? Maybe you wanted to learn you first programming language and do not know what to choose.  When learning a new language (especially your first language) you want to minimize the amount of unknowns that you will have.  So you may want to choose a programming language that is more simple. Or maybe you are up for a challenge and want to learn something difficult! Today we are going to attempt to answer the question: *What makes programming languages simple or complex?*

## Previous ExperienceThe amount of experience you have programming, learning different programming concepts can greatly impact how well you learn a new language.  If this is your tenth programming language you will have most likely seen plenty of what is in this new programming language so that can greatly reduce the complexity.  On the other hand, if this is your first language, you will be learning so many new concepts and ideas that are natural to programming that will make the language seem more complex than it probably is. **Takeaway: The more programming experience you have, the lower the chances a programming language will be complex to you.**## SyntaxThe way you need to write the code for that language can really affect the complexity.  Some languages have many syntax rules that can be a nuisance when learning and make you look at the code like this:![???Image](https://github.com/acucciniello/BlogPostImages/blob/master/Complex-Simple-Programming-Languages/???.jpg)Other languages have less rules that will make it easier to understand for someone not familiar to the language.  Also for those with previous experience, if the new language has similar syntax to the new language, it will help in the learning process.Another factor similar to syntax is how the code looks to the user.  In my experience, the more the code has variable/function names that resemble the English language, it is easier to understand it.**Takeaway: The more syntax rules the more difficult a language can be to learn.**  ## Built-in FunctionalityThe next factor is how much built-in functionality a language has.  If the language has been around for years and is being continuously updated, chances are it has plenty of helper functions and plenty of functionality.  In the case of some newer languages, they might not have as much built-in functionality that allows you to develop easier. **Takeaway: Generally, languages with more functionalities built in will generally make it easier for implement what you need.**## ConceptsThe fourth topic we are going to discuss here is concepts.  That is, what programming concepts does this language use.  There are plenty out there like object oriented programming, memory management, inheritance and more. Depending on what concepts are used in the language as well as your previous understanding of a concept you could either really struggle with some the language, or you could potentially find it easier than most.**Takeaway: Your previous experience with specific concepts and the complexity of the concepts in the language could affect the complexity of the language as a whole.** ## Frameworks & LibrariesFrameworks and Libraries are very similar to *Built-in Functionality*.  Frameworks and Libraries are developed to make something in the language easier or to simplify a task that you would normally have to do yourself in code.  So, with more frameworks you could make development easier than normal.**Takeaway: If a language has plenty of support from libraries and frameworks, the language will decrease in complexity.**## ResourcesOur last topic here is arguably the most important.  Ultimately, without high quality documentation it can be very hard to learn a language.  When looking for resources on a language, check out books, blog posts, tutorials, videos, documentation and forums for making sure there is plenty of resources on the topic.**Takeaway: The more high-quality resources out there on the programming language, the easier it will be to learn.**## Conclusion When deciding on what programming languages are complex or simple, it truly depends on a few factors: your previous experience, the syntax of the language, built-in functionality, the concepts used, frameworks for support, and high quality resources available.If you enjoyed this post share it on [twitter][twit]!
