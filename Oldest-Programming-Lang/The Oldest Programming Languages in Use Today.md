# The Oldest Programming Languages in Use Today## IntroductionWe are going to be reviewing some of the oldest programming languages that are still in use today! If you are a newer developer (younger than some of these languages) then you will probably be surprised how old some of these languages are and the fact that they are still used today (especially in a world where technology is advancing and accelerating at an insanely fast rate.) Let us start with the oldest ones and work our way closer to today. 

## C![CImage](https://github.com/acucciniello/BlogPostImages/blob/master/Oldest-Programming-Lang/c.png)The C language was created in 1972 (Wow that is old). C is a lower level language that was based an earlier language called B (It looks like they knew their alphabet.) It is a general purpose language that is the parent language that many languages we will discuss here derive from such as C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP and Python.  It is used in many applications that must interface with hardware or play with memory.
## C++

Pronounced (See-plus-plus). This was developed 11 years later in 1983.  It is very similar to C in fact it is often considered an extension of C.  It added various concepts such as classes, virtual functions, and templates.  It is more of an intermediate level language, that can be used lower level or higher level depending on the application making it very useful.  It is also known for being used in low latency applications.## Objective-C

![ObjCImage](https://github.com/acucciniello/BlogPostImages/blob/master/Oldest-Programming-Lang/objC.png)At the same time as C++ was being sent to the public, Objective-C was created.  If you took an educated guess from the name and said that it would be another extension of C then you are right.  This version was meant to be an object oriented version of C. It is used famously by Apple.  If you are a Mac or iOS user, then your iPhone or Mac applications were probably developed with Objective-C (until they recently moved over to Swift.)## Python

![PythonImage](https://github.com/acucciniello/BlogPostImages/blob/master/Oldest-Programming-Lang/python.jpeg)We are going to take quick jump ahead in time to the 90s for this one.  In 1991, the Python programming language was created.  It is a dynamically typed object oriented language that is often used for scripting and web applications today.  It usually used with some of its frameworks like Django or Flask on the backend.  It is one of the most popular programming languages in use today.
## Ruby![RubyImage](https://github.com/acucciniello/BlogPostImages/blob/master/Oldest-Programming-Lang/ruby.jpeg)

In 1993, Ruby was released. Today, you probably heard of Ruby on Rails, which primarily is used to create the backend of web applications using Ruby.  Unlike the many languages derived from C, this language was influenced by older languages such as Perl and Lisp.  This language was designed for productive and fun programming.  This was done by making the language closer to human needs rather than machine needs.
## Java

Two years later, Java was developed.  This is a high level language that is derived from C.  It is famously known for its use in web applications and as the language to use to develop Android Applications and Android OS.  It used to be the most popular language a few years ago, but its popularity and usage has definitely decreased.

## PHP

In the same year as Java was developed PHP was born.  It is an open source programming language developed for the purpose of creating dynamic websites.  It is also used for server side web development.  Its usage is definitely declining but it is still in use today.

## JavaScript

![JSImage](https://github.com/acucciniello/BlogPostImages/blob/master/Oldest-Programming-Lang/js.png)That same year, JavaScript was brought to the world.  Its purpose was to be a high level language that helped with the functionality of a web page.  Today it is sometimes used as a scripting language and on the backed of applications with the release of Node.js.  It is currently one of the most popular and widely used programming languages today.## Conclusion That was our brief history lesson on some in use programming languages.  Even though some of these languages are 20, 30, or even 40 years old, they are being used by thousands of developers daily. They all have a variety of uses from lower level to higher level, from web applications to mobile applications.  Do you think we need some newer languages or are you happy with what we have?
