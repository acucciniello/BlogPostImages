# Why is Python So Popular?## Introduction

![PythonImage](https://github.com/acucciniello/BlogPostImages/blob/master/Oldest-Programming-Lang/python.jpeg)In 1991, the Python programming language was created.  It is a dynamically typed object oriented language that is often used for scripting and web applications today.  It usually used with some of its frameworks like Django or Flask on the backend.  

Since its creation it is still widely used and one of the most widely used languages in the world.  But why is this the case?  Today we will look at the reason why the Python Programming Language is still extremely popular in these recent years.

## Used by Bigger CompaniesThe first reason why Python is so popular is because it is widely used by Bigger Technology companies.  If the bigger tech companies (think companies such as Google) use the language, then the engineers that work there also use it. If the developers use this at their job, they will take it to their next job and pass the knowledge.   
## Plenty of Style is Not Used

In Python, whitespace is important where as in other languages such as JavaScript and C++ it is not. The whitespace is used to dictate the scope of the statements in that indent.  By making whitespace important it reduces the need for things like brackets and semicolons in your code. 

That reduction alone can make your code look simpler and cleaner.  People are always more willing to try a language that looks and feels more clean as it seems easier to learn.## Tons of Libraries and 3rd Party Support

Being around as long as it has, Python has plenty of built in functionality.  It has an extremely large standard library with plenty of things that you can use in your code.  

On top of that, it has plenty of third party support libraries that make takes even easier.  All of this gained functionality allows programmers to focus on the more important logic that is vital to the application's core functionality.  Therefore, this makes programmers more efficient, and who does not like efficiency?## Object Oriented

As mentioned in the Introduction, Python is an Object Oriented Programming Language.  Due to it being Object Oriented, more people are likely to adopt it.  Object Orient Programming allows developers to model their code very similar to real world behavior. 
## Built-in Testing

Python allows you to import a package called `unittest`.  This package is a full unit testing suite with setup and teardown functions.  Having this built it makes something that is stable for developers to use to test their applications.

## Readability and Learnability

As we mentioned earlier, the whitespace is important therefore we do not need brackets and semicolons.  Also we mentioned Python is dynamically typed so it is easier to create and use variables not really having to worry about the type.

All of these topics could be difficult for new programmers to learn.  Python makes it easier by removing some of the difficult parts and having nicer looking code.  The reduction to entry allows people to choose Python as their first programming language. (This was my first programming language.)

## Well Documented

Building upon the standard libraries and the vast amount of 3rd party packages, the code in those applications are usually well documented.  They are tend to have plenty of helpful comments and tons of additional documentation to explain what is happening.  

From a developer stand point this is crucial.  Having great documentation can make or break a language's usage for me.   

## Many Applications

To top it off, Python has many applications it can be used in.  It can be used to develop games for fun, web applications to aid businesses, and data science applications.  

The wide variety of usage attract more and more people to python because when you learn the language you now have the power to make any of these types of applications.
## Conclusion With all of these benefits who would not consider python as their next language of choice?  There are many options out there, but Python tends to be superior when it comes to readability, support, documentation, and its wide application usage.If you enjoyed this post share it on [twitter][twit]!
