# Native v Web apps - What's Driving User Behavior and What Does it mean for Developers?


## Introduction

So, you are thinking of what kind of application to make for your business or product to make.  This can be a tough decision but we will explore what a developer should know before diving in to one of them.  There are some recent trends that have been affecting how people spend most of their time on the internet and on their devices.  Let us explore the difference between the two.


## What is a Native App?

A Native Application is a program that is created to be used on a specific operating system or device.  When we refer to a Native App normally we are referring to a mobile app.  These are normally developed for specific device or platform use.  For example, an iPhone app such as Apple's Map app that is created specifically to run on devices running iOS.  Since these apps are created for specific devices, they can take advantage of the hardware and OS for that device. 


## What is a Web App?

A Web Application is a program that is stored on a server some where and given to the user through internet on a web browser.  This is normally developed to be accessed on a broad amount of devices and operating systems.  The same web app can be used on Android and iOS.  These apps do not need to be downloaded by the user, all the user needs is a browser and an Internet connection.

## What is Driving User Behavior?

Now that we know what the difference is between Native and Web apps let's talk about the trends that have affected user behavior.

### Screen Size

Over the past couple of years, the average screen size has increased from three inches back in 2007 all the way to five inches in 2014.  Some phones these days are six inches! As the screen sizes get larger, it is easier for the user to do more on their mobile device.

### Internet Access

Year by year more and more people have internet access and this is partially due to the amount of smartphones. People have internet nearly where ever they would like and whenever they would like.

### Phone Hardware

Over the recent years, phones can now take 4K images and video. The screen resolutions have even increased up to 4K recently.  RAM has increased in devices also, with some devices having four GB of RAM which is what some lower end computers.  

**Verdict**: All of the improvements  in phone hardware and increased internet access makes it easier to do things on the go with their mobile devices.

## What does this mean for Developers?

What can we do now that we know all this information to help us with our decision? Well, depending on your scenario and your end goal, you may lean towards one versus the other.  

Native Apps, need to be developed using multiple IDEs and individually for each different operating system.  This can be more expensive because if you would like a good outreach it would be necessary to develop and update an app for iOS, Android and Windows devices.  That also involves learning three programming languages.  Then once the app is made it needs to be accepted by three different app stores. 

On the other hand, if you make the native app, the user can access their app without internet connection and you can design it to be easier to use for that device.  You can also take advantage of the hardware and the apps are generally more secure because they need to be approved by the app stores.  

Web Apps, can be developed one time and be used on a broad spectrum of devices.  If you make a change to the code on the server, then you change how it is viewed for all of the individual devices, making it faster to make.  If a user has used the web app on their computer, then they would be familiar with the flow and design of the site.  It is easier to maintain and build therefore cheaper to make.  

Even with those advantages, you cannot directly access the hardware of the device through the browser.  You must have an internet access to get to the web app.  Also because it is created for various devices, the design and use of the app is not optimal for the user. 

## Conclusion

If you are looking to make something faster and cheaper but the quality of the app does not need to be optimal for the user, then you should develop a web app.  If you have the resources (money and time) to develop a native app, then it could be a great advantage for the user.
